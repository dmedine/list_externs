[listtool] and [listorder] are utilities for dealing with lists in Pd. These are mostly just for convenience, but [listorder] does have some nice sorting options that are pretty gnarly to do in Pd without an extern.

building:
---------
Linux:
Drop the list_externs folder into Pd's extra folder and hit 

> make

in a terminal. You can also specify the include path (needed to find m_pd.h) by typing:

> make LINUXINCLUDE=-I<full path to pd's src folder>

where the full path is something like /home/dmedine/Software/pd-0.45-4/src 

Mac:
You will need to change the fourth line of the makefile from:

current: pd_linux

to:

current: pd_darwin

Or, you can specify the extension by adding:

EXT=pd_darwin 

to your make command.

then, it's the same as for linux. The makefile uses the same variable LINUXINCLUDE for both linux and mac build options, so the same deal applies.

installing:
-----------
The folder list_externs has two externs (assuming the build was successful) and two helpfiles in it. You will have to specify the path to these files in the Pd path environment.
